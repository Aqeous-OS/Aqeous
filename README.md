I know, the name's stupid. You can tell that to Ashish. Not like he's gonna change it. But, either way, have a look at our OS.
We've been developing it for months now. It's still in its infancy, but it's shaping up to be a good OS. Oh, by the way, did I
mention that we're trying to make it better than UNIX? You know, that all-purpose, super awesome OS that everybody loves? Yup.
Hopefully, if a certain someone (*cough* Ashish *cough*) hasn't broken the makefile, you'll be able to see it in all it's glory.
The code isn't very well commented, we'll take care of that a bit later, because we want to reach a usable OS before anything.
Maybe the documentation helps you out. It's in the html directory.
Hey, if you enjoyed going through the code, and liked it, consider forking it. Either way, I need to go grind coffee soon before I start
coding this again, so yeah...- Happy coding guys :)
